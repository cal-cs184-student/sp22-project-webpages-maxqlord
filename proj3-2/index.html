		<h1>CS184 Project 3-2 - Max Lord and Eugenia Gavrilova</h1>
		<h2>
			Overview
		</h2>
		<p>
			<h3>1. An overview of the project, including your approach to and implementation for each of the parts, as well as what problems you have encountered and how you solved them.</h3>

			<br />
		</p>

		<h2>
			Part 2
		</h2>
		<p>
			<h3>1. Show a sequence of 4 images of scene CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae rendered with \alphaα set to 0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5.
				The other settings should be at least 128 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5.
				Describe the differences between different images.</h3>

			<br />
			<h3>2. Show two images of scene CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae rendered using cosine hemisphere sampling (default) and your importance sampling.
				The sampling rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5.
				Briefly discuss their difference.</h3>

			<br />
			<h3>3. Show at least one image with some other conductor material, replacing eta and k. Note that you should look up values for real data rather than modifying them arbitrarily.
				Tell us what kind of material your parameters correspond to.</h3>

			<br />

		<h2>
			Part 4
		</h2>
		<p>
			<h3>
				1. In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model.
			</h3>
				A pinhole camera is essentially a special case of a thin-lens camera with an aperture of 0.
				As aperture size increases, the number of light rays hitting the scene increases, which blurs the returned 2d image.
				The thin lens allows a ray not going through the center to bend, so rays may intersect with different parts of the scene
				and cause more blur or focus in some parts depending on the focal distance and aperture.
				The key to the difference is more rays playing a role in intersecting with the point in focus and surrounding objects,
				and that focus can be adjusted with the focal distance and aperture settings.
			<br />
			<h3> 2. Show a "focus stack" where you focus at 4 visibly different depths through a scene.</h3>
				Aperture: 0.5, Depth 4.5, 4.8, 5.0, 5.3
				<br />
				<img src="depth5Spheres45.png" width="40%" />
				<img src="depth5Spheres48.png" width="40%" />
				<img src="depth5Spheres50.png" width="40%" />
				<img src="depth5Spheres53.png" width="40%" />

			<br />

			<h3>
				3. Show a sequence of 4 pictures with visibly different aperture sizes, all focused at the same point in a scene.
			</h3>
				Depth: 4.5, Aperture 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5
				<br />
				<img src="depth05ASpheres45.png" width="40%" />
				<img src="depth1ASpheres45.png" width="40%" />
				<img src="depth3ASpheres45.png" width="40%" />
				<img src="depth5ASpheres45.png" width="40%" />

		<h2>
			Collaboration
		</h2>
		We split up the project—one partner did part 2 and the other did part 4. We kept in contact regarding our progress
		and used git branches so we didn't interfere with each other's work.
